# Python

Code from "Foundations of Computing" assignment completed at the 
University of Melbourne. The purpose of the code was to act as a 
card player for a specific card game. The rules of the card game 
were modified by my professor from those of a real-life card game 
(Unfortunately, I don't remember the name of the game). The code is 
long since it had to 'compete' against other students' code (the 
same way players compete against each other during a card game). 
The matches were run many times on a platform called Grok 
(https://groklearning.com/), the results were averaged out and a 
final ranking was given based on how well your code did against others. 
My code was ranked 32th out of possibly more than 500 students (can't 
remember the exact number, but it was a huge class).
